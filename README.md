# ICARUS
ICARUS is a Maxwellian-averaging code developed as a part of my final year project. It solves the reaction rate integral by approximating it with a riemann sum and replacing the infinite upper limit with a sufficiently large finite value. Some sample input files have also been uploaded for reference. For more information regarding the theoretical formalism, the readers are requested to refer to my thesis titled "ANALYSIS OF THERMONUCLEAR REACTION RATES FOR NUCLEI BEYOND A=50" (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/376349659_Analysis_of_Thermonuclear_Reaction_Rates_for_Nuclei_beyond_A50). In the output file, the first column represents average energy in units of keV, and the second column represents the corresponding stellar temperature in units of 10^9 K, the third column represents the Maxwellian-averaged cross sections (MACS), and the fourth column represents the thermonuclear reaction rates. It can be coupled with codes like YAHFC to extend them for astrophysical applications.
